## First steps

It was such a challenge to make this project. I had to learn a lot of new things, and I'm still learning.


## What I need to learn

- [ ] next/auth
- [ ] next/image


## Things to improve

- [ ] Add a better design (I'm capable of but I need more data to make a better design).
- [ ] Add a better accessibility (If I had to make a bigger project, I would use a library like [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-aria](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-aria) to make a better accessibility).
